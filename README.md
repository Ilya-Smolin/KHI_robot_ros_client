# KHI_robot_ros_client
This client is created with QT Framework to send and receive data with KHI_robot package for ROS
***

Set signals wit `set_signals` - is like Ethernet/IP interface, but number of signals,  that can be set  
with `set_signals` is limited with string length  

The fastest and the most useful service is `AS` - you can use it like telnet_client, its working average  
time is 120ms (`set_variable` and `get_variable` are using this service)  

`Move or stop robot` button sets some signal in robots memory

AS service cannot run in two threads so send and receive data are serial  

The main poin to use services is the fact that you can get responce from robot  

`Write to TXT` - writes received data string to file.txt

Also in this client you can use telnet to communicate with robot  

Please if you want to use it install khi_robot following installation manual:
